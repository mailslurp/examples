Aliases must be validated. Email aliases can be used to hide real email addresses behind an alias. If you wish to receive emails with an alias attach an inbox to the alias.\n       Whenever the inbox receives an email the email will be forwarded to the alias email address. See related `threads`. Threads can be used with aliases to enable replying to a proxied email. This means that when threads are enabled an email alias will \n       create a new email thread for the message and set the replyTo and from headers on the subsequently proxied email to point to the threads unique email address. \n       By replying to this address the thread will forward it to the original emails sender or replyTo and use the same subject and bcc and cc contacts as the email you are replying to. For more advanced email operations using aliases use the inboxId for the given alias.\n"},{"name":"EmailController","description":"Endpoints for managing email entities. Send and read email using the email API. You can fetch emails and attachments, reply to emails, and send new emails with this controller. Emails belong to inboxes. \nEach inbox can contain unlimited emails that are either permanent or temporary depending on your setup. Because emails can be quite large when attachments and content are fetched most responses only include a preview of the email and its most important features, like subject, recipients etc and an ID. Many list results are in a paginated form using an index (zero based) and a page size. To receive email decide on either `waitFor` methods (such as `waitForLatestEmail` on the `WaitForController`) to wait for emails to arrive. Use `getEmails` on `EmailController` or `getInboxEmails` on the `InboxController` to list existing emails. To access the body or attachments of an email you need to use the `getEmail` and `getAttachment` endpoints with specific inbox and email IDs. The body is returned on full email entities and contains the parsed body of the email. The email headers (such as recipients, subject etc.) are stored on the email object. You can access the RAW SMTP message via various `raw` methods. Attachments are treated as separate entities that have an ID and belong to the email. To fetch email attachments first fetch the full email then use a `downloadAttachment` method for each `attachmentID`. Attachments are transferred in a number of ways as either `application/octect-stream` byte arrays or as base64 encoded strings with meta data. You may prefer either depending on the environment you are in but the base64 implementations are typically safer. See the `AttachmentController`, `InboxController`, and `WaitForController` for similar methods. \n    "},{"name":"FormController","description":"Form controller for submitting email-able forms"},{"name":"ConsentController","description":"Endpoints for managing double opt-in consent for sending promotional material to external email accounts."},{"name":"RulesetController","description":"Endpoints for creating and managing inbox rulesets. Inbox rulesets are sets of rules that can be automatically applied to inbound and outbound emails for an inbox. Rulesets can have a scope, action, and target. The scope is receiving or sending emails. The action is to block, allow, or forward an email. The target is pattern or email address depending on the action. The handler can be used to handle rules silently or trigger an exception when they occur. See inbox controller for similar methods.\n"},{"name":"SentEmailsController","description":"Endpoints for viewing sent email receipts. These can be used to verify that an email has been sent or for historical records. Email content and attachments are stored. For legacy reasons the default send endpoint does not return a sent email. Use the `sendEmailAndConfirm` methods to receive a sent email receipt after sending."},{"name":"GuestPortalController","description":"\"Endpoints for managing guest portals and customer access to shareable email accounts.

If an inbox has an expiration date when it is created it will expire at that time and an ExpiredInboxRecord will be created for it listing the email address and inbox ID.

Also includes endpoints for listing emails within inboxes. \nInboxes are a core feature of MailSlurp. Each inbox has a unique ID and emailAddress. If your plan allows custom domains you can create inboxes with custom addresses that end in your domain. \nBy default inboxes are assigned a random email address ending in `@mailslurp.biz`. Use the domainPool options to use a randomly selected domain from a pool of available domains. Whenever you create an inbox MailSlurp will register the address and store any emails sent to the address within your inbox. \nYou can use the `InboxController` endpoints to list the emails in an inbox. To get the contents or attachments of an email use the ID returned from `InboxController` methods to call the `EmailController` endpoints.\"\n"},{"name":"MFAController","description":"Multi-factor authentication (MFA) endpoints for MailSlurp.

The endpoints are perfect for synchronous blocking calls, long-polling, or tests (see webhooks if you need to respond to email events as they happen using HTTP notification). These wait endpoints are all built around a common idea - that you ask for an expected number of emails from an inbox and MailSlurp will either: A) Return the matching emails if they are present; B) Hold a connection open until the matching emails are are received or until a timeout occurs. For test suites we recommend that you create a new inbox for each test run  and use the waitForLatestEmail to hold the connection until the email you expect arrives. Note if your inbox is not already empty waitFor methods may return immediately depending on their implementation. See each endpoint for more details."},{"name":"InboxForwarderController","description":"Endpoints for creating and managing inbox forwarders.

Attachments can be uploaded in a number of ways: as base64 encoded strings, as byte array octet streams, and as multipart form requests. Each upload method returns an array whose first element is the ID of the attachment. Use this Id to send the attachment with emails. See the EmailController `download` endpoints for downloading attachments. Attachment downloads are based on the email ID they belong to and can be downloaded using the email controller."},{"name":"BounceController","description":"Endpoints for access to bounced emails and bounced recipients"},{"name":"WebhookController","description":"Endpoint for interacting with webhooks. Webhooks have a URL that points to your server. Useful for email forwarding, email API processing and more. They can be added to inboxes and when an inbox receives an email the email ID and inbox ID will be posted to the URL endpoint at your server. The schema of the webhook payload is available at https://api.mailslurp.com/schemas/webhook-payload or by calling https://api.mailslurp.com/webhooks/test. Use webhooks to react in real-time to inbound emails. Use the webhook payload posted to your server to fetch the full emails or attachments if you need them. Use the event ID as an idempotent record. The ID identifies the webhook payload uniquely. MailSlurp tracks webhook processing. It will try not to send the same event twice but it can happen. If you receive the same event more than once you can ignore it and assume it is the same. It is recommended that you use a store or database to track webhooks you have processed to avoid processing events more than once."},{"name":"AIController","description":"AI endpoints for generating

        <con:description>Create a new inbox and with a randomized email address to send and receive from. Pass emailAddress parameter if you wish to use a specific email address. Creating an inbox is required before sending or receiving emails. If writing tests it is recommended that you create a new inbox during each test method so that it is unique and empty. </con:description>

            <con:description>A custom email address to use with the inbox. Defaults to null. When null MailSlurp will assign a random email address to the inbox such as `123@mailslurp.com`. If you use the `useDomainPool` option when the email address is null it will generate an email address with a more varied domain ending such as `123@mailslurp.info` or `123@mailslurp.biz`. When a custom email address is provided the address is split into a domain and the domain is queried against your user. If you have created the domain in the MailSlurp dashboard and verified it you can use any email address that ends with the domain. Note domain types must match the inbox type - so `SMTP` inboxes will only work with `SMTP` type domains. Avoid `SMTP` inboxes if you need to send emails as they can only receive. Send an email to this address and the inbox will receive and store it for you. To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID.</con:description>

            <con:description>Use the MailSlurp domain name pool with this inbox when creating the email address. Defaults to null. If enabled the inbox will be an email address with a domain randomly chosen from a list of the MailSlurp domains. This is useful when the default `@mailslurp.com` email addresses used with inboxes are blocked or considered spam by a provider or receiving service. When domain pool is enabled an email address will be generated ending in `@mailslurp.{world,info,xyz,...}` . This means a TLD is randomly selecting from a list of `.biz`, `.info`, `.xyz` etc to add variance to the generated email addresses. When null or false MailSlurp uses the default behavior of `@mailslurp.com` or custom email address provided by the emailAddress field. Note this feature is only available for `HTTP` inbox types.</con:description>

If an expiration date is provided or is required by your plan the inbox will be closed when the expiration time is reached. Expired inboxes still contain their emails but can no longer send or receive emails. An ExpiredInboxRecord is created when an inbox and the email address and inbox ID are recorded. The expiresAt property is a timestamp string in ISO DateTime Format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX.</con:description>

            <con:description>HTTP (default) or SMTP inbox type. HTTP inboxes are default and best solution for most cases. SMTP inboxes are more reliable for public inbound email consumption (but do not support sending emails). When using custom domains the domain type must match the inbox type. HTTP inboxes are processed by AWS SES while SMTP inboxes use a custom mail server running at `mxslurp.click`.</con:description>

This method allows for page index (zero based), page size (how many results to return), and a sort direction (based on createdAt time). You Can also filter by whether an inbox is favorited or use email address pattern. This method is the recommended way to query inboxes. The alternative `getInboxes` method returns a full list of inboxes but is limited to 100 results.</con:description>

        <con:description><![CDATA[This endpoint allows you to submit HTML forms and receive the field values and files via email. 

#### Parameters
The endpoint looks for special meta parameters in the form fields OR in the URL request parameters. The meta parameters can be used to specify the behaviour of the email. 

You must provide at-least a `_to` email address to tell the endpoint where the form should be emailed. These can be submitted as hidden HTML input fields with the corresponding `name` attributes or as URL query parameters such as `?_to=test@example.com`

The endpoint takes all other form fields that are named and includes them in the message body of the email. Files are sent as attachments.

#### Submitting
This endpoint accepts form submission via POST method. It accepts `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and `multipart/form-data` content-types.

#### HTML Example
```html
<form 
  action="https://api.mailslurp.com/forms"
  method="post"
>
  <input name="_to" type="hidden" value="test@example.com"/>
  <textarea name="feedback"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### URL Example
```html
<form 
  action="https://api.mailslurp.com/forms?_to=test@example.com"
  method="post"
>
  <textarea name="feedback"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```



The email address is specified by a `_to` field OR is extracted from an email alias specified by a `_toAlias` field (see the alias controller for more information). 
Endpoint accepts . 
You can specify a content type in HTML forms using the `enctype` attribute, for instance: `<form enctype="multipart/form-data">`.
