/** Options for creating an inbox. An inbox has a real email address that can send and receive emails. Inboxes can be permanent or expire at a given time. Inboxes are either `SMTP` or `HTTP` mailboxes. `SMTP` inboxes are processed by a mail server running at `mailslurp.mx` while `HTTP` inboxes are processed by AWS SES backed mailservers. An inbox email address is randomly assigned by default ending in either `mailslurp.com` or (if `useDomainPool` is enabled) ending in a similar domain such as `mailslurp.xyz` (selected at random). To specify an address use a custom domain: either pass the `emailAddress` options with `&lt;your-recipient&gt;@&lt;your-domain&gt;`. To create a randomized address for your domain set the `domainName` to the domain you have verified or pass the `domainId`. Virtual inboxes prevent outbound sending and instead trap mail. */

If you use the `useDomainPool` option when the email address is null it will generate an email address with a more varied domain ending such as `123@mailslurp.info` or `123@mailslurp.biz`. When a custom email address is provided the address is split into a domain and the domain is queried against your user. If you have created the domain in the MailSlurp dashboard and verified it you can use any email address that ends with the domain. Note domain types must match the inbox type - so `SMTP` inboxes will only work with `SMTP` type domains. Avoid `SMTP` inboxes if you need to send emails as they can only receive. Send an email to this address and the inbox will receive and store it for you. To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID. */
